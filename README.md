# Stream Server

Make sure you do `git submodule update --init --recursive` before anything
else!!

## First use

Do `vagrant up` to start and provision the vm.

## Not first use

Do `vagrant up && vagrant provision` to start the vm.
Note that the bootstrap.sh script will skip steps if they have already been
performed previously.
